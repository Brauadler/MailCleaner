               <ul>
                 <li> <h2>What does Mailcleaner do ?</h2>
                      Mailcleaner is a mail filter that check your incoming messages against spams, known viruses and other dangerous content, avoiding them to even reach your desktop. It is a server side solution which means you don't have any software to install on your system to get your mails fitered. This is actually done by your mail account provider. With this web based interface, you are directly connected to the Mailcleaner filter, where you will see blocked spams and will be able to tune some settings of the filter.
                 </li>
                 <li> <h2>What is a spam ?</h2>
                      A spam is an unsolicited or undesired email message. Generally used for advertisements, these messages can quickly fill your mailbox. These message are generally not dangerous, but really annoying.
                 </li>
                 <li> <h2>What are viruses and dangerous content ?</h2>
                      Viruses are small softwares that can exploit and let some malicious people take control of your computer. These can be sent to you by email as attachments, and infect your system once you open it (some can even be enabled without being opened). Dangerous content are the same, except that they can be enabled by more intelligent means, hidding themselves directly into the content of the message, or even being targeted from the outside by a bounce link into the mail. These are very difficult to be detected by a standard mail filter because the real virus is not really included with the message. Mailcleaner does more check on that a prevent potentially risky mail to reach your mailbox.
                 </li>
                 <li> <h2>Mailcleaner antispam criteria</h2>
                      Mailcleaner uses a number of test in order to detect spams with the best accuracy possible. It uses amongst others, some simple keyword or keyphrase matching, worldwide spam databases and statisticall token computing. The aggregation of all these criterias will give an overall score for each message, upon wich mailcleaner will take the final decision: spam or ham. As spam is a really fast moving target, these rules are also adapted as fast as possible. This is the job of Mailcleaner to keep these settings as good as possible.
                 </li>
                 <li> <h2>Errors</h2>
                      As Mailcleaner is an automated filtering system, it is also prone to mistakes. There are basically two kinds of error that can be generated by Mailcleaner:
                      <ul>
                       <li> <h3>false negatives</h3> false negatives are spam messages that slipped through the Mailcleaner filter and reach your mailboxe without being detected. These are annoying, but as long as they keep relatively rare, they won't hurt to much your production at work. Remember when you got only a couple of spam each week ? Mailcleaner can get you at least to this point.
                       </li>
                       <li> <h3>false positives</h3> are more annoying errors as they are valid mails being blocked by the system. If you are not vigilant enough and does not check either your quarantine or reports carefully, this can lead to the lost of important messages. Mailcleaner is optimised to reduce these mistakes as much as possible. However, altough it is very very rare, this can happens. That why Mailcleaner includes real-time quarantine access and periodic reports to help you minimize the risk of message lost.
                       </li>
                      </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li> <h2>What you can do to correct Mailcleaner</h2>
                      Upon Mailcleaner mistakes, the best thing to do is help correct the filter by giving feedback to your administrator. Do not think the best solution is just to whitelist or blacklist senders as this is just a fast but dirty way (check this for more informations). Althoug it sometimes is the only possibility, it is always better to find out the real cause of the error, and correct it. This can only be done by technical people, so don't hesitate to give feedback on errors to your administrator.
